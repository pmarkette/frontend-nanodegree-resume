# My Resume

http://pmarkette.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-resume/

This is an online resume that showcases my ability to use JavaScript to dynamically build a web page. For this project I was provided with pre-written HTML and CSS templates. I created all data in JSON, then wrote functions that combine the data with the HTML and CSS templates to dynamically build the DOM.
